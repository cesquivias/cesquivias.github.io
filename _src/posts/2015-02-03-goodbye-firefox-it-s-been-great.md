    Title: Goodbye Firefox. It's been great

It's finally come to the point where I have to leave Firefox and switch to a new browser (Chrome). I've continued to use and promote Firefox for the last few years even though I knew deep down that Chrome was the superior browser. I have to stop being so stubborn.

Breaking the IE6 Hegemony
=========================

I started using Firefox back when it was still in it's 0.9x versions. A friend of mine turned me onto it, and I instantly fell in love. Not only did it not have all the problems with malware that IE had but it had a builtin search bar! My enthusiasm spilled into becoming a Mozilla acolyte, expounding the benefits of an open web and getting people off of IE. I forbade my family and friends using IE and to stick with Firefox. Some ignored me but thankfully most either listened or used whatever browser shortcut was on their desktop ðŸ˜›.


Firefox: Because it was the best
================================

Sure, several websites didn't render properly on Firefox. Some even required ActiveX plugins. That didn't really phase me. Firefox had extensions! Need a website to render in IE? Just install the extension that will use the IE engine on those unique occasions. You had all the benefits of Firefox's chrome (UI) with IE still available in your back pocket.

Things were even better on the web development side. At this time I was learning HTML, CSS & Javascript and Firebug was a godsend. I remember trying debug apps in IE and just getting a line number and column. IE didn't even have a source viewer. The HTML source opened in Notepad. Dark times in IE land indeed. Thankfully on the Firefox side I had a DOM viewer, a debugger, source highlighter, you name it.

The extensions just kept getting better. I liked messing with themes like others, but having extensions like Scrapbook or googling a highlighted word. But my favorite Firefox feature: custom keyword searches. You can take any search bar and make it a first class citizen in your browser. Firefox made me feel like the web was in the palm of my hand.


The New Kid in Town
