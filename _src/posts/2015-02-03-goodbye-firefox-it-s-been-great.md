    Title: Goodbye Firefox. It's been great

It's come to the point where I have to leave Firefox. Firefox is just not cutting it, so I'm moving to Chrome. I continued using and promoting Firefox for a few years even though I knew deep down Chrome was the superior browser. It's time to face my cognitive dissonance. Firefox just isn't that good anymore.

In the Beginning: Get Me Off IE6!
=================================

I started using Firefox back when it was still in it's 0.9x versions. A friend of mine turned me onto it, and I instantly fell in love. Not only did it not have problems with malware that IE had, but it has a builtin search bar! My enthusiasm spilled into becoming a Mozilla acolyte expounding the benefits of an open web and getting people off of IE. I forbade my family and friends from using IE and to stick with Firefox. Some ignored me but thankfully most listened or used whatever browser shortcut was on their desktop ðŸ˜›.


Firefox: Because it was the best
================================

Sure, a few websites didn't render properly on Firefox. Some even required ActiveX plugins. That didn't really phase me. Firefox had extensions! Need a website to render in IE? Just install the extension that will use the IE engine on those unique occasions. You had all the benefits of Firefox's chrome (UI) with IE still available in your back pocket.

Things were even better on the web development side. At this time I was learning HTML, CSS & Javascript, and Firebug was a godsend. I remember trying to debug web sites in IE and just getting a line number and column. IE didn't even have a source viewer. The HTML opened in Notepad. Dark times in IE land indeed. Thankfully on the Firefox side we had a DOM viewer, a debugger, source highlighter, you name it.

The extensions just kept getting better. I liked messing with themes like others, but having extensions like Scrapbook or googling a highlighted word was where it's at. My favorite Firefox feature: custom keyword searches. You can take any search field and make it a first class citizen in your browser. Firefox made me feel like the web was in the palm of my hand.


The New Kid in Town
===================

As you probably know Google released Chrome and joined the Browser Wars 2.0. I tried Chrome out when it was first released and didn't find anything spectacular about it. V8 showed promise but Mozilla promised to speed up their Javascript engine as well so there weren't any compelling reasons to switch. I attributed the first set of friends who switched as a the fanboy group. I still do. But as more people switched over I started becoming the lone wolf in the Firefox pack. The reasons subtly switched from "Firefox is better" to "Firefox does everything I need." Easy profile switching? Sandboxed tabs? Sure they're nice, but I didn't notice the difference. Besides, Firefox sandboxed plugins like Flash, and that's what's most important, right? Chrome didn't have a dedicated search bar; you entered your search terms into the address bar. Big whoop; I've been doing that for years (thanks again, custom keywords). I knew Firefox and was very productive in it. My many years of accumulated bookmarks and custom keywords meant something.


The Downhill Slide
==================

I don't know when I started noticing problems in Firefox. I've heard of memory issues with Firefox, but I never had those problems. I've actually had worse memory problems with Chrome--especially with GMail. Go figure. I did notice that things felt slower on Firefox. Perhaps having one huge process for my 20 tabs wasn't the best solution.

Though not a technical problem it was Firefox's revamped UI that really opened my eyes and assess the program I stare at for hours a day. When I started Firefox the first time with the new UI I reacted with anger. It looked like Chrome! Really, Mozilla, is this what it's come to? If I wanted to use Chrome, I'd use Chrome. After that first insult subsided I began to think, what is Mozilla telling me? Do they think that people use Chrome because it has rounded tabs and a hamburger menu? Now I was angry again. But maybe Mozilla wasn't trying to insult my intelligence. Afterall, we have new version of Sync in the same release (though it was incompatible with the previous version) so they've been doing other stuff.

Yet for all the work they've been doing they still haven't finished Electrolysis--their codename for Firefox with multiple processes. That isn't to say it's been a huge failure. The work has helped on Firefox OS, but who's using that? They haven't released it for their flagship product: the desktop browser. They even put it on hold a few years back. I guess Firefox OS was more important to the detriment of the product that everyone uses and will judge you on. Electrolysis is slated to come out in 2015, but it's become too little too late for many--myself included. I hope it was worth it.

Even if multiprocess Firefox comes out and it's great, that's not what bothers me the most. I don't know what Mozilla did but now rendering in Firefox on Windows has all kinds of bugs. Portions of the page don't rerender properly nor the UI. I return to the browser and the whole thing turns black. Sometimes it just freezes. A CPU shoots up to 100% (we're only on one process, afterall) and I can't kill it and Windows becomes unresponsive. For a while I've been pushing the blame onto AMD. I would say my Radeon graphics card has some bad drivers though I never get these bugs when playing games. But when it started happening on my laptop with Intel integrated graphics. Well now there's no excuse: it's Firefox. Sure, I could disable GPU rendering, or I could use a browser that doesn't have these issues.


Goodbye
=======

So I'm dropping Firefox in favor of Chrome (or Chromium on Linux). At this point most people ask me with bemusement and slight disgust, "why are you still on Firefox?" I typically respond by saying that Firefox is a great browser, and I'm well versed in its menus and shortcuts. The browser UI is more important to me than the OS on which I use it. Though the browser UI is really importnat, I can't honestly say that Firefox is the best browser. It's an acceptable browser, but so is IE. If you want less trouble use Chrome.

I still believe in Mozilla and love what they stand for, but they promote open source (as opposed to free software) and in open source the better product should win. My interaction with Mozilla will now consist of referencing their great Mozilla Developer Network (MDN). I'll keep an eye out, Firefox, but you've frustrated me one too many times.

Last week my wife was having trouble with Firefox again. She has to use the Citrix Receiver plugin for her job, but whenever Firefox self updates it hangs before a browser window ever appears. When she gets paged the last thing she wants to do is uninstall Firefox, reinstall it and reinstall Citrix Receiver. This time my not-usually-demure wife asked "I'm going to start using Chrome, okay?" After all my proselitizing I can't fault her coyness, and after all Firefox has put us through I can't fault her decision. I decided to do the same. Right after I told her it's okay Firefox pops up she exclaims "Oh, it's working!" Sorry, Firefox, you had your chance.
